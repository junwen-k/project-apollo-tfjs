I was told duting opening the account, I can make principle pre-payment anytime, then I can allocate that payment back to regular installment.  But right now the flexibility is not available online.  I have to call Branch as only they can perfom that for me.  I would like request for RHB to allow such flexibility to allocate my principle pre-payment to installment myself.",
